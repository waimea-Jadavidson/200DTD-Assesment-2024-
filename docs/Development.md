#### Development: UI Design v0.1
Basic layout of the website UI and possible media/text. This was based on the initial feedback from the stakeholder.
> "We have high percentage of people who are not as tech savy, the website will need to concise and be able to always have a way out."

### 2024/05/30
#### Development: UI Design v0.2
I have add more go back and cancel buttons, making it easier to navigate around the website for users who are on the older side and don't understand the web as well. The association does have a percentage of members who are over 70 and as not as tech savy. This was mentioned by the stakeholder when he saw the first iteration of the basic UI. He was happy with the flow diagram but wanted it more replicated in the basic ui.
>"I like the more concise navigation, being able to cancel at every stage and providing that way back. This makes it accessible to all our members."

#### Development: UI Design v0.3
I have generated a colour scheme, I will send this through to my stakeholder to receive some feedback which will be listed here. I choose this neutral colour scheme because its easy to see and read and the blues are linked to the ocean. Ignore the weird looking whites, these are to show that information will be put there, not related to the colours

### 2024/06/13
#### Development: UI Design v0.5
I have updated my look to be more cleaner and efficient, I did this after receiving some feedback from my pairs on how the website flowed and how the UI was designed. I am happy with this newer design and it is an improvement. I showed my previous design to my stakeholder. The feedback has been mentioned down below and this is why I asked for some advice from my pairs.
> You have everything there, but I feel as if the UI is too cluttered and your design with some of the buttons needs to fixed and you need to be more consistent with the buttons and how you color them and linking them. This is important because the association has older members who are not as tech savy. It needs to flow.

### Development: UI Update
After talking to my stakeholder, we released we do not actually need the more information button as we currently display all the info in the vent box on events list page. So I have removed anything to do with this. It makes the website function better as well as flow around and not confuse any users.

#### Development: Memeber Attending Event
During the holidays I acquired some stakeholder feedback on current progress
>I like the progress you have made so far Jasper, the website has come a long way colour and design wise. However I am concerned with the lack of functionality at the moment, lots of the key features are currently missing, like attending events and adding new members as well. I would like to see some more functionality added in please.
