# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **NZFDA Association**

Project Author: **Jasper Davidson**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**

#### Note:
>Regatta and Event term are used interchangeably throughout this project

>Public end-user group is optional and only if i have time. It is not core functionally or end user

-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

National Secretary has no way to track Class Members, Regattas and who is attending regattas. As well as acting as a public front for the NZFDA where they can point new and prospective sailors

### End-User Requirements

#### Class Members 

* Seeing Regatta Events that are upcoming  
* Be able to say that their attending events

* Not all It iterate, will need to use plain and simple design
* Plain and simple language

#### National Secretary 

* Being able to see class members 
* Who is attending Regattas 
* Being able to create Regattas

* Easy to use, will not take up massive amounts of time, as he does have a day job
* Can be done off a laptop

#### Public

* Find out class and association information
* Find joining information
* Look at pictures and media

* Not all possibly sailors, so refrain from using sailing language

### Proposed Solution

#### National Secretary should be able to:

* Add Users, Remove Users, Edit Users Information (Includes Boat information)
* Add Events, Remove Events, Edit Events
* (Optional) Add Event/Boat Photos

#### Class Members should be able to:

* See and react to Events
* (Optional) Look at event photos/boat photos

#### Public (Optional)

* Find out class and association information
* Find joining information
* Look at pictures and media

## Relevant Implications

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-users, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

This implication is important for my website because there are two groups of end-users. The website will have to work for all groups and it has different functionality for all of them. So working is a key point.

Everything will be impacted by this implication. I will need to consider how I go about designing the website and making sure it is meeting it's intended purpose at the end of it. To make sure it works 100%, I will need to test regularly at every step and thoroughly.

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

This implication is important because both end-user groups will need to be able to use the website easily and in the quickest way that allows them to. Everyone has busy lives, so streamlining process is key. It also has to work for the public so they can see information and media that they need but not anything else.

I will need to consider Nielsen usability heuristics, for example consistency and standards. I will need to keep my UI designs consistent and to a standard, this will make sure the end users do not get confused. Another one is user control and freedom, I will need to allow the user to cancel or go back out of everything. Because some of the end users are not great with technology, this will be key.

### Privacy

The privacy implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to protecting the privacy of end-users and their data.

This implication is important because I will be storing members key information like name, phone, email etc etc.

To make sure I achieve this, I will need consider data base layout and the permissions that the each end user have to provide the most secure way to storing and holding the information so only the authorized people can access this information as well as endeavour to only hold the needed information and nothing else. 

### Legal

The legal implications of storing and using media and data and making sure it conforms to all relevant NZ Law.

This is important because I will be show and storing media that is relevant to the class and association. So making sure all of it complies with relevant law is key. I am also storing members personnel data, so it has to conform to relevant NZ privacy and data Laws.

I will need to consider what media I use and where as well as how, this is will start from the beginning. Also making sure that data is collected and stored safely and I plan out how I am going to do that. Doing it wrong at the start could lead to issues later on when I have to fix it and it becomes a mess.

### End-User

This implication means making sure that the needs of the End-Users are understood and then meet within the website

This is important because I have multiple End-Users with vastly different needs, so meeting the requirements of these end-users will be key.

I will need to consider all of the mentioned implications above as the all come under this implication. Making sure I meet this implication is key because it is the most important one.

## Final System Design

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.


-------------------------------------------------

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
