# Teacher Feedback on Documentation and Other Evidence

> Good start. Few tweaks needed in first sections.


## System Requirements	

- [x] **A** Purpose of outcome identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [ ] **A** End-users identified and described, listing specific requirements
- [x] **A** Key functionality that satisfies the purpose and end-user requirements identified
- [ ] **A** Implications, relevant to purpose and end-users, are described and linked to design of outcome

> The end-user section should be you describing your groups of end-users and any needs / requirements they have (e.g. in terms of usability, etc.) - see the exemplar. What you've written should be moved to Proposed Solution section

> Implications - well described, but you need to explain exactly what you'll do during the project to satisfy them (e.g. Functionality - if you want it to work 100%, you'll need to test regularly and thoroughly)

> Usability - This should be way more thorough, referencing Nielsen's heuristics, etc.


## Database Structure	

- [x] **A** Structure of the database is designed (tables, fields, data types, primary keys, relationships, etc.)
- [x] **M** Structure of the database is logical (i.e. DB is normalised, tables / fields are named logically, etc.)

> Good


## Front-End UI Designs

- [ ] **A** Design for key web pages have been sketched out with supporting notes, etc.

> Good start - would be good to see iterations of the design with changes based on feedback


## System Testing

### Functionality Testing

- [ ] **A** Functionality has been tested and there is evidence for this (screenshots, etc.)
- [ ] **M** Testing is thorough (all functionality covered)

> Comments...  

### Code Testing

- [ ] **E** Code (HTML and CSS) validates. Documented evidence for this

> Comments...  


## Improvements Based on Testing

- [ ] **M** Info. from testing has been used to improve the outcome
    - [ ] End-user feedback has been used to improve the system

### Iterative Improvements

- [ ] **E** Evidence of a series of planned, iterative design-test-improve cycles (at least three) used to refine one or more aspects of outcome
    - [ ] Design of the UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented UI has been iterated
    - [ ] Implemented functionality has been iterated

## Review and Evaluation

- [ ] **M** Discussion of how the relevant implications were addressed in the implementation of the outcome
